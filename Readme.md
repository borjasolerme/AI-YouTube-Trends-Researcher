The AI YouTube Trends Researcher is a Google Colab notebook that utilizes the Anthropic Claude AI model to generate video ideas based on trending YouTube videos for a given topic. It analyzes the trending videos, identifies key trends and insights, and provides actionable recommendations for creating successful content.

## Features

- Ranks the video trends based on the frequency of topics and total view counts
- Generates a mini report analyzing the trends, patterns, and opportunities for content creation
- Provides video ideas inspired by the trending videos and the generated mini report
- Saves the mini report, video ideas, and trending video information in a Word document

## Prerequisites

- Google Colab account
- Anthropic API key (replace `YOUR KEY HERE` with your actual API key)
